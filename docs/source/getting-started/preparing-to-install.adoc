[[installing-overview]]
== Overview

The following section describes how to install {project} and the required dependencies.

These are the basic steps for setting up {project} on your personal system:

. xref:../getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.adoc#[Set up your virtualization environment]
. Download {project} software for your operating system from the link:{download-url}[{download-text}] page
. xref:../getting-started/installing.adoc#[Install {project}]
. xref:../getting-started/quickstart.adoc#starting-minishift[Start {project}]
. xref:../using/basic-usage.adoc#runtime-options[Configure {project}] so you can use it efficiently

The setup procedure should be run as a regular user with permission to launch virtual machines.
In the procedure, you will see how to assign that permission, along with ways to configure your hypervisor and command shell to start and effectively interact with {project}.

[[install-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

{project} requires a hypervisor to start the virtual machine on which the OpenShift cluster is provisioned.
Verify that the hypervisor of your choice is installed and enabled on your system before you set up {project}.
Once the hypervisor is up and running, additional setup is required for {project} to work with that hypervisor.

Depending on your host operating system, you have the choice of the following recommended native hypervisors:

macOS::

Linux::
- link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine[KVM]

Windows::
- link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v[Hyper-V]
+
[NOTE]
====
To use {project} with Hyper-V ensure that, after you link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v[install Hyper-V], you also link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/connect-to-network[add a Virtual Switch] using the Hyper-V Manager and set the configuration option `hyperv-virtual-switch` to this virtual switch.
For specific configuration steps see the xref:../getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.adoc#setting-up-hyper-v-driver[Setting Up the Hyper-V Driver] section.

All Platforms::

+
[NOTE]
====
VirtualBox 5.1.12 or later is recommended on Windows to avoid the issue xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-driver-plugins.adoc#machine-doesnt-exist[Error: machine does not exist].
If you encounter issues related to the hypervisor, see the xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-driver-plugins.adoc#troubleshooting-driver-virtualbox[Troubleshooting Driver Plug-ins] section.
====

Refer to the xref:../getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.adoc#[documentation for each hypervisor] to determine the hardware and operating system versions needed to run that hypervisor.
