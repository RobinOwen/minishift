[[developing-overview]]
== Overview

The following sections describe how to build and test {project}.

[[develop-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

- Git
- A recent Go distribution (>=1.8)

[NOTE]
====
You should be able to develop {project} on Linux, macOS or Windows.
The Windows operating system might require additional steps or have some limitations.
====

[[set-up-dev-env]]
== Setting Up the Development Environment

[[create-go-workspace]]
=== Creating the Go Workspace

We highly recommend to setup a default Go link:https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces[workspace].
Even though it might require an adjustment in your work processes, the goal is to have a single workspace for all Go development.

. Create the following directories in the base directory you want to use, such as *_$HOME/work_*:
+
/bin::
Contains executable commands

/pkg::
Contains package objects

/src::
Contains Go source files

. Add the path of the root workspace directory to the `GOPATH` environment variable.
For example:
+
----
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work
----

. Add the workspace *_bin_* directory to the `PATH` environment variable:
+
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
----

[NOTE]
====
On Windows operating systems, you use the UI or a shell-specific approach to set environment variables.

For Command Prompt, see link:https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754250.aspx[`set`] and link:https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755104.aspx[`setx`].

For PowerShell, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables[About Environment Variables].
====

[[cloning-repository]]
=== Cloning the Repository

Get the {project} sources from GitHub:

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src
$ git clone https://github.com/minishift/minishift.git github.com/minishift/minishift
----

[[using-ide]]
=== Using an IDE

You can use any editor you want.
However, most of the core maintainers of {project} use IntelliJ link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IDEA] with the latest Go plug-in.
This IDE indexes your whole workspace and allows for easy navigation of the sources, and also integrates with the Go debugger link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve[Delve].

For instructions on setting up IDEA, see link:http://hadihariri.com/2015/09/30/setting-up-go-on-intellij/[Setting up Go on IntelliJ].

[[manage-dependencies]]
== Dependency Management

{project} uses link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Dep] for dependency management.

[[install-dep]]
=== Installing Dep

Before you can use Dep you need to download and install it from GitHub:

----
$ go get github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
----

This will install the `dep` binary into *_$GOPATH/bin_*.
Make sure to use Dep version 0.4.1 or later.

[[update-dependencies]]
=== Updating Dependencies

If your work requires a change to the dependencies, you need to update the Dep configuration.

. Edit *_Gopkg.toml_* to change the dependencies as needed.

. Run `make vendor` to fetch changed dependencies.

. Test that everything still compiles with changed files in place by running `make clean && make`.

Refer dep documents for more information.

. link:https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html#updating-dependencies[dep document about updating dependencies]

. link:https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html#adding-a-new-dependency[dep document about adding a dependency]

[[recreate-vendor-directory]]
=== Re-creating vendor Directory

If you delete *_vendor_* directory which contain the needed {project} dependencies.

To recreate *_vendor_* directory, you can run the following command:

----
$ make vendor
----

This command calls and runs Dep.
Alternatively, you can run the Dep command directly.

----
$ dep ensure -v
----

[TIP]
====
The Dep cache located under *_$GOPATH/pkg/dep_*.
If you see any Dep errors during `make vendor`, you can remove local cached directory and try again.
====

[[build-minishift]]
== Building {project}

[[build-minishift-binary]]
=== Building the minishift Binary

Run the following command to create a platform-specific binary and copy it to *_$GOPATH/bin_*.

----
$ make
----

[NOTE]
====
Use `make cross` to cross-compile for other platforms.
====

[[run-minishift-binary]]
=== Running the minishift Binary

Start the OpenShift cluster with your built `minishift` binary:

----
$ minishift start
----

This command will run {project} from *_$GOPATH/bin/minishift_*, if you set up your Go workspace as described in the xref:create-go-workspace[Creating the Go workspace] section.

You can also execute the binaries directly from the *_out_* directory of the checkout.
Depending on your operating system, the binary is in one of the following directories:

* *_out/darwin-amd64_*
* *_out/linux-amd64_*
* *_out/windows-amd64_*

For more {project} commands and flags, see the xref:../command-ref/minishift.adoc#[{project} command reference] documentation.

[[unit-tests]]
=== Unit Tests

Unit tests run on *Travis* before the code is merged.
To run tests during the development cycle:

----
$ make test
----

To run specific tests, use one of the following methods:

- Run all tests on a single package.
+
----
# Eg: go test -v ./cmd/minikube/cmd
$ go test -v <relative path of package>
----
- Run a single test on a single package.
+
----
$ go test -v <relative path of package> -run <Testcase Name>
----
- Run tests that match a pattern.
+
----
$go test -v <relative path of package> -run "Test<Regex pattern to match tests>"
----

For more information about test options, run the `go test --help` command and review the documentation.

[[integration-tests]]
=== Integration Tests

Integration tests utilize link:https://github.com/DATA-DOG/godog[Godog], which uses Gherkin (Cucumber) to define sets of test cases.
These test cases are known as _features_ in Gherkin terminology.
Features are located in the *_test/integration/features_* directory.
Features for {project} follow these basic concepts:

User stories::
Features which follow a happy path of user.
For example, *basic.feature* or *coolstore.feature*.

Feature and command coverage::
Features which focuses on specific fields of {project} functionality or individual commands.
For example, *proxy.feature* or *cmd-version.feature*.

[[running-integration-tests]]
==== Running Integration Tests

By default, tests are run against the binary created by `make build` (*_$GOPATH/bin/minishift_*).
To run the basic test, use the following command:

----
$ make integration
----

[NOTE]
====
`make integration` only runs tests which are tagged as `@basic` by default.
====

To run all of the tests, use the following command:

----
$ make integration_all
----

[NOTE]
====
There is also a `make integration_pr` target which is being run as part of pull request testing.
====

===== Additional Parameters

The default targets `integration` and `integration_all` can be further customized using several parameters to provide more flexibility.

MINISHIFT_BINARY::
The `MINISHIFT_BINARY` parameter can be used to run integration tests against a `minishift` binary located in a different directory:

----
$ make integration MINISHIFT_BINARY=<path-to-custom-binary>
----

TIMEOUT::
The `TIMEOUT` parameter can be used to override the default timeout of `10800s`.
To run all the tests with a timeout of `7200s`, use the following command:

----
$ make integration_all TIMEOUT=7200s
----

RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE::
The `RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE` parameter specifies {project} commands to be run before each feature.
This provides the ability to run integration tests against a {project} instance which is not in its default state.
When multiple commands are specified, they must be delimited by a semicolon.
For example, tests can be run against a stopped {project} instance with the image caching option turned on by running the following: 

----
$ make integration_all RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE="start; stop; config set image-caching true"
----

COPY_OC_FROM::

To test {project} with a non-default `oc` binary you can use the `COPY_OC_FROM` parameter.
This parameter specifies the path to the `oc` binary which will be copied into the `$MINISHIFT_HOME` folder before each feature run.
Note that the `oc` binary must be contained in the same directory structure which {project} uses for the storage of `oc` binaries, for example: `<version>/<platform>/oc(.exe)`.
For example, to test {project} with locally stored `oc v3.7.23` run:

----
$ make integration COPY_OC_FROM=<path-to-oc-directory>/v3.7.23/<linux or windows or darwin>/oc RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE="config set openshift-version v3.7.23"
----

TEST_WITH_SHELL::

About:::
The majority of {project} integration tests pass command line arguments directly to the `minishift` or `oc` binaries via Go's `os/exec` package.
However, some integration tests first start persistent instance of the shell to pass commands into later, for example: `When user starts shell instance on host machine`.
Due to persistency of the shell instance all changes done in it will be present until its closure, for example, changed environmental variables.
This allows testing of commands which are dependent on the shell they are being executed in.
The steps using this approach have the `shell` keyword in their definition, for example: `When executing "minishift oc-env" in host shell succeeds`.

Usage:::
`TEST_WITH_SPECIFIED_SHELL` is an optional parameter.
If nothing is passed with `TEST_WITH_SPECIFIED_SHELL`, then the shell type is automatically determined.
By default, the shell will be PowerShell on Windows, Bash on macOS and Linux.
The `TEST_WITH_SPECIFIED_SHELL` parameter can be used to run the tests with different shells.
To run the tests using the Windows Command Prompt, for example, run `make integration_all TEST_WITH_SPECIFIED_SHELL=cmd`.
The `TEST_WITH_SPECIFIED_SHELL` parameter supports the `powershell`, `cmd`, `bash`, `tcsh` and `zsh` options.

[[godog-options]]
==== Using the GODOG_OPTS Parameter

The `GODOG_OPTS` parameter specifies additional arguments for the Godog runner.
The following options are available:

Tags::
Use `tags` to ensure that scenarios and features containing at least one of the selected tags are executed.
To select particular feature, you can use its name as a tag.
For example, the `cmd-config.feature` contains `@cmd-config` tag through which it can be selected and run with the following command: `make integration GODOG_OPTS=--tags=cmd-config`.
There are also tags covering specific areas and usages of {project}:

- The `@command` tag indicates that the feature file tests commands, for example `cmd-addons.feature`.
- The `@openshift` tag indicates that the feature file has tests related to OpenShift.
- The `@addon` tag indicates that the feature file tests particular add-on functionality.

Paths::
Use `paths` to define paths to different feature files or folders containing feature files.
This can be used to run feature files outside of the *_test/integration/features_* folder.

Format::
Use `format` to change the format of Godog's output.
For example, you can set the format to `progress` instead of the default `pretty`.

Stop-on-failure::
Set `stop-on-failure` to `true` to stop integration tests on failure.

No-colors::
Set `no-colors` to `true` to disable ANSI colorization of Godog's output.

Definitions::
Set `definitions` to `true` to print all available step definitions.

[NOTE]
====
Passing any value via `GODOG_OPTS` overrides the default tag definition on each integration target.
Thus in this case `--tags` must be specified manually, otherwise all features will be run.
====

For example, to run integration tests on two specific feature files using only `@basic` and `@openshift` tags and without ANSI colors, the following command can be used:

----
$ make integration GODOG_OPTS="-paths ~/tests/custom.feature,~/my.feature -tags basic,openshift -no-colors true"
----

[NOTE]
====
Multiple values for a `GODOG_OPTS` option must be separated by a comma without whitespace.
For example, `-tags basic,openshift` will be parsed properly by `make`, whereas `-tags basic, openshift` will result in only `@basic` being used.
====

==== Viewing Results

The integration test logs its progress directly into a console.
This information is often enough to find and debug the reason for a failure.

However, for cases which require further investigation, the integration test also logs more detailed progress into a log file.
This file is located at *_$GOPATH/github.com/minishift/minishift/out/test-results/integration_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.log_*.


[[integration-tests-as-package]]
==== Using Integration Tests as a Package

Integration tests can be also used as a package outside of the {project} repository.
You can import it as `github.com/minishift/minishift/test/integration/testsuite`.
As a starting point for your project you can copy and use the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/test/integration/integration_test.go[`test/integration/integration_test.go`] file.
Its key parts are commented to help you to begin with the implementation.

[[format-source-code]]
=== Formatting the Source Code

{project} adheres to the Go link:https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting[formatting guidelines].
Code with incorrect formatting will fail the CI builds.
You can check whether any of your files violate the guidelines with the following command:

----
$ make fmtcheck
----

You can correct the formatting errors yourself or instruct the violations to be corrected automatically with the following command:

----
$ make fmt
----

You can also check for common coding mistakes by using:

----
$ make vet
----

Similar to `make fmtcheck`, failures in `make vet` will fail the CI builds.

[[commit-message-requirements]]
=== Commit Message Requirements

Each commit message must meet two requirements:

* the commit subject is strictly less than 90 characters (GitHub ellipsis length).
* the commit subject matches the format `Issue #[0-9]+ .*`, meaning each commit must reference an issue.

The Makefile contains a `validate_commits` target which can be used to verify these requirements:

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only xref:../contributing/ci.adoc#ci-system-summary[Circle CI] validates the commit message as part of the CI build.
====

----
$ make validate_commits
----

[[clean-workspace]]
=== Cleaning the Workspace

To remove all generated artifacts and installed dependencies, run the following command:

----
$ make clean
----

[[godoc]]
== Godoc

When developing {project}, it is encouraged to use link:https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc[Godoc] to document the source code.
You can find guidelines on how to use Godoc in link:https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code[this blog post].
You can browse the {project} Godoc documentation under link:https://godoc.org/github.com/minishift/minishift[https://godoc.org/github.com/minishift/minishift].
