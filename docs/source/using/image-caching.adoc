[[image-caching-overview]]
== Overview

To speed up the provisioning of the OpenShift cluster and to minimize network traffic, container images can be cached on the host.
These images can then be imported into the running Docker daemon, either explicitly on request or implicitly during xref:../using/basic-usage.adoc#minishift-start-overview[`minishift start`].
The following sections describe image caching and its configuration in more detail.

[TIP]
====
The format in which images are cached has changed with {project} version 1.10.0.
Prior to 1.10.0 the images were stored as tar files.
As of 1.10.0, images are stored in the link:https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md[OCI image format].

If you used image caching prior to {project} 1.10.0, your cache will need to be recreated.
If you want to remove the obsolete pre 1.10.0 images, you can clear your cache via:
----
$ minishift delete --clear-cache
----
====

[[explicit-image-caching]]
== Explicit Image Caching

{project} provides the `image` command together with its sub-commands to control the behavior of image caching.
To export and import images from the Docker daemon of the {project} VM, use `minishift image export` and `minishift image import`.

[[single-images]]
=== Importing and Exporting Single Images

Once the {project} VM is running, images can be explicitly exported from the Docker daemon:

----
$ minishift image export <image-name-0> <image-name-1> ...
Pulling image <image-name-0> .. OK
Exporting <image-name-0>. OK
Pulling image <image-name-1> .. OK
Exporting <image-name-2>. OK
----

[NOTE]
====
Images which are not available in the Docker daemon will be pulled prior to being exported to the host.
====

To import previously cached images, use the xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_import.adoc#[`minishift image import`] command:

----
$ minishift image import <image-name-0> <image-name-1> ...
Importing <image-name-0> . OK
----

[[listing-cached-images]]
=== Listing Cached Images

The xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_list.adoc#[`minishift image list`] command lists either the currently cached images or the images available in the {project} Docker daemon.

To view currently cached images on the host:

----
$ minishift image list
openshift/origin-docker-registry:v3.6.0
openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v3.6.0
openshift/origin:v3.6.0
----

To view images available in the Docker daemon:

----
$ minishift image list --vm
openshift/origin-deployer:v3.6.0
openshift/origin-docker-registry:v3.6.0
openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v3.6.0
openshift/origin-pod:v3.6.0
openshift/origin:v3.6.0
----

[[persisting-image-names]]
=== Persisting Cached Image Names

In order to avoid having to type the image names explicitly as part of the `image export` or `image import` command, you can store a list of image names for import and export in the persistent configuration.

Use xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_cache-config_view#[`minishift image cache-config view`] to view the list of currently configured images and xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_cache-config_add#[`minishift image cache-config add`] to add images to the list:

----
$ minishift image cache-config view
$ minishift image cache-config add alpine:latest busybox:latest
$ minishift image cache-config view
alpine:latest
busybox:latest
----

To remove images from the list use xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_cache-config_remove#[`minishift image cache-config remove`]:

----
$ minishift image cache-config remove alpine:latest
$ minishift image cache-config view
busybox:latest
----

Once the image names are stored in the persistent configuration, you can run xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_export#[`minishift image export`] and xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_import#[`minishift image import`] without any arguments.

[[all-images]]
=== Exporting and Importing All Images

You can export and import all images using the `--all` flag.
For the export command, this means that all images currently available on the Docker daemon will be exported to the host.
For the import command, it means that all images available in the local {project} cache will be imported into the Docker daemon of the {project} VM.

[WARNING]
====
Exporting and importing all images can take a long time and locally cached images can take up a considerable amount of disk space.
We recommend using this feature with caution.
====

[[implicit-image-caching]]
== Implicit Image Caching

Image caching is enabled by default for {project}.
It occurs in a background process after the xref:../command-ref/minishift_start#[`minishift start`] command is completed for the first time.
Once the images are cached under *_$MINISHIFT_HOME/cache/images_*, successive {project} VM creations will use these cached images.

To disable this feature you need to disable the `image-caching` property in the persistent configuration using the xref:../command-ref/minishift_config_set#[`minishift config set`] command:

----
$ minishift config set image-caching false
----

[NOTE]
====
Implicit image caching will transparently add the required OpenShift images to the list of cached images as specified per `cache-images` configuration option.
See xref:../using/image-caching.adoc#persisting-image-names[Persisting Cached Image Names].
====

[TIP]
====
Each time an image exporting background process runs, a log file is generated under *_$MINISHIFT_HOME/logs_* which can be used to verify the progress of the export.
====

You can re-enable the caching of the OpenShift images by setting `image-caching` to `true` or removing the setting altogether using xref:../command-ref/minishift_config_unset#[`minishift config unset`]:

----
$ minishift config unset image-caching
----

[[delete-images]]
== Delete Image from local cache

Images are cached under *_$MINISHIFT_HOME/cache/images_* and stored as sha256 blob along with an index which contains detail about matching sha with image name.

To delete an image from the local cache, use the xref:../command-ref/minishift_image_delete.adoc#[`minishift image delete`] command:

----
$ minishift image delete <image-name-0> <image-name-1> ...
Deleting <image-name-0> from the local cache OK
Deleting <image-name-1> from the local cache OK
----
