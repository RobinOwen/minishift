[[uninstall-overview]]
== Overview
This section describes how you can uninstall {project} and delete associated files.

[[uninstall-instructions]]
== Uninstalling {project}

.  Delete the {project} VM and any VM-specific files:
+
----
$ minishift delete
----
+
This command deletes everything in the *_$MINISHIFT_HOME/.minishift/machines/minishift_* directory.
Other cached data and the xref:../using/basic-usage.adoc#persistent-configuration[persistent configuration] are not removed.

.  To completely uninstall {project}, delete everything in the `MINISHIFT_HOME` directory (default *_~/.minishift_*) and *_~/.kube_*:
+
----
$ rm -rf ~/.minishift
$ rm -rf ~/.kube
----

.  With your hypervisor management tool, confirm that there are no remaining artifacts related to the {project} VM.
For example, if you use KVM, you need to run the `virsh` command.
