[NOTE]
====
- Assigning a static IP address to the {project} VM is only officially supported for Hyper-V.
- The {project} VM cannot be assigned a static IP address when using the KVM driver plug-in.
- An experimental `--set-static` flag is available for the `minishift ip` command for other hypervisors.
See xref:../using/experimental-features.adoc#set-fixed-ip[Set Fixed IP Address] for more information.

[[static-ip-hyperv]]
== Assign IP Address to Hyper-V

Since the Internal Virtual Switch for Hyper-V does not provide a DHCP offer option, an IP address needs to be provided in a different way.
Functionality is provided to assign an IP address on startup using the Data Exchange Service for Hyper-V.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This only works with the CentOS or RHEL xref:../using/basic-usage.adoc#choosing-iso-image[ISO] in combation with Hyper-V.
The Boot2Docker ISO image experiences a problem when the values are being sent to the {project} instance and consumed by the Boot2Docker ISO.
We are looking into the issue and hope to provide a solution in the future.

to make this work, you need to create a link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/setup-nat-network[Virtual Switch using NAT].

[NOTE]
====
WinNAT is limited to one NAT network per host.
For more details about capabilities and limitations, please see the link:https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2016/05/25/windows-nat-winnat-capabilities-and-limitations/[WinNAT capabilities and limitations blog].

The following command will attempt to assign an IP address for use on the Internal Virtual Switch 'MyInternal':

----
PS> $env:HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH="MyInternal"
PS> minishift.exe start `
  --iso-url centos `
  --network-ipaddress 192.168.1.10 `
  --network-gateway 192.168.1.1 `
  --network-nameserver 8.8.8.8
----

If you want to use the 'DockerNAT' network, the following commands are needed to setup the correct NAT networking and assign an IP in the range expected:

----
PS> New-NetNat -Name SharedNAT -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 10.0.75.1/24
PS> $env:HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH="DockerNAT"
PS> minishift.exe start `
  --iso-url centos `
  --network-ipaddress 10.0.75.128 `
  --network-gateway 10.0.75.1 `
  --network-nameserver 8.8.8.8
----

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to specify a valid gateway and nameserver.
Failing to do so will result in connectivity issues.
