[[docker-daemon-overview]]
== Overview

When running OpenShift in a single VM, you can reuse the Docker daemon managed by {project} for other Docker use-cases as well.
By using the same Docker daemon as {project}, you can speed up your local development.

[[docker-daemon-configuration]]
== Console configuration

In order to configure your console to reuse the {project} Docker daemon, follow these steps:

. Make sure that you have the Docker client binary installed on your machine.
For information about specific binary installations for your operating system, see the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker installation] site.

. Start {project} with the xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`] command.

. Run the xref:../command-ref/minishift_docker-env.adoc#[`minishift docker-env`] command to display the command you need to type into your shell in order to configure your Docker client.
The command output will differ depending on OS and shell type.

----
$ minishift docker-env
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.101:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/john/.minishift/certs"
export DOCKER_API_VERSION="1.24"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(minishift docker-env)
----

. Test the connection by running the following command:
+
----
$ docker ps

If successful, the shell will print a list of running containers.
